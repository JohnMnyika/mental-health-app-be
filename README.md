## About

The **Mental Health Support and Awareness App** backend is built using Node.js and GraphQL with Apollo Server. It provides the necessary APIs for the frontend of the app to communicate with the database and retrieve information related to mental health resources, support, and user interactions.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the following link:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mental-health-app-be.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd mental-health-app-be
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Key Features

- **GraphQL API:** The backend uses GraphQL to provide a flexible and efficient API for the frontend to interact with.

- **Apollo Server:** Apollo Server is used to implement the GraphQL server, handling queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

- **Database Interaction:** The backend connects to a database (such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve data related to mental health resources, user information, and more.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data security and privacy.

## Setting Up the Database

1. Choose a database system that you want to use (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

2. Set up the database and configure the connection in the backend codebase.

## Running the Backend

To start the backend server, run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

The server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Contributing
